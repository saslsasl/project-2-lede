Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br>

And how else can it be?<br>
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.<br>
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?<br>
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?<br>
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.<br>
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.<br>
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”<br>
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.<br>
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.<br>

seat though she hadn’t driven in years, me in the passenger, her ride-<br>

tiny border town, before we realized This isn’t our van! & we scrambled<br>

In the fifth century BCE, Heraclitus wrote that the way up<br>
is the way down. Like my five empty bottles of merlot in recycle<br>
and the depression I’d fallen into before quitting my job—<br>
clinical director of the county emergency shelter—<br>
which meant talking to children after their father lit them on fire,<br>
the foster parents forcing them to eat from a dog bowl on the floor<br>
while the biological kids ate at the dinner table.<br>
The saints were all about suffering: scourges, crucifixion, drownings.<br>
Nothing but death led a saint to give up on intercession.<br>

Or to paraphrase Heraclitus, the pope decides if a saint’s way down<br>
is the way up. For ten years, that girl was returned to us after every failed<br>
placement, with a new tattoo or piercing for every john she’d tricked,<br>
only to hang herself on her eighteenth birthday.<br>
It was March, vernal equinox, first day of spring. Emancipated Minor,<br>
they called her at Social Services, meaning no money, nowhere to go.<br>
Did I already say she was extraordinarily beautiful?<br>
Before her, I thought beauty was easy to see. Something the spirit feasted on,<br>
while the saints starved themselves on behalf of the afflicted.<br>

Stare at the plum tree that secretly erupted into blossom overnight.<br>
I still can’t tell you the girl’s name, but I’m whispering it to myself.<br>

and all her privacies, of the tenuous<br>
sheen of her thin gray hair,<br>
and the sculptural, elegant way<br>
she piled it high up on her head.<br>

she returns, conjuring the images<br>
that made her real, transcending<br>
the withered anonymities of elderly<br>
citizens one passes in the street<br>
without even noticing a whole life<br>
is walking by…<br>
Gertrude’s<br>
agony seemed different from ours.<br>
Older. Well-thumbed. Polite<br>
And buckled to her person<br>
Like a well-fitting garment. Ours?<br>
Untamed, sharp-edged and shouting.<br>
Hungry infant, railing in a crib. Not<br>
noiseless and ancient like hers.<br>
Nor glamorous as a hologram<br>
Of anguish, flickering and glittering<br>
with broken fragments of<br>
captured light which lit her up<br>
inside her grief and made her<br>
glow…<br>
Surely she could not<br>
be as fragile as she looked,<br>
carrying that weight. We craved<br>
the object lesson of her tragedy<br>
thinking it would teach us how<br>
to transcend our sobbing,<br>
corporeal essences that grieved<br>
us so, and held us back as we<br>
kept on searching for the sure<br>
way out: the red door marked exit<br>

anyway—perceiving the torment<br>
still living inside her that we thought<br>
she had conquered. The mystery was how<br>
someone insignificant and ordinary<br>
as Gertrude had redistributed<br>
that weight, and reoriented<br>
the magnetic poles that for us<br>
always defaulted to agony.<br>
She had been our hero,<br>
icon of a victory that could<br>
one day be ours if we learned<br>
to live as Gertrude lived: elegant<br>
and stoical, silencing our constant<br>
clamoring for relief. But now<br>
here she was: testifying to victory<br>
or defeat? We could not tell, and that<br>

having been allowed an early entry<br>
to the Hermitage, my family and I wandered<br>
the empty hallways and corridors, virtually every space<br>
adorned with famous paintings and artwork.<br>
There must be a term for overloading on art.<br>
One of Caravaggio’s boys smirked at us,<br>
his lips a red that betrayed a sloppy kiss<br>
recently delivered, while across the room<br>
the Virgin looked on with nothing but sorrow.<br>
Even in museums, the drama is staged.<br>
Bored, I left my family and, steered myself,<br>
foolish moth, toward the light coming<br>
from a rotunda. Before me, the empty stairs.<br>
Ready to descend, ready to step outside<br>
into the damp and chilly air, I felt<br>
the centuries-old reflex kick in, that sense<br>
of being watched. When I turned, I found<br>
no one; instead, I was staring at The Return<br>
of the Prodigal Son. I had studied it, written about it<br>
as a student. But no amount of study could have<br>
prepared me for the size of it, the darkness of it.<br>
There, the son knelt before his father, his dirty foot<br>
left for inspection. Something broke. As clichéd<br>
as it sounds, something inside me broke, and<br>
as if captured on film, I found myself slowly sinking<br>
to my knees. The tears began without warning until soon<br>
I was sobbing. What reflex betrays one like this?<br>
What nerve agent did Rembrandt hide<br>
within the dark shades of paint that he used?<br>
What inside me had malfunctioned, had left me<br>
kneeling and sobbing in a museum?<br>

this ridiculous story, a friend who spoke Russian<br>
translated the guard’s words for me: “Just cry. Just cry.<br>
Free yourself.” But free myself from what, exactly?<br>

the next time you feel yourself going dark<br>
in a poem, just don't, and see what happens.<br>
That was when Matt, Deborah Landau,<br>
Catherine Barnett, and I were chatting,<br>
on our way to somewhere and something else.<br>
In her office, a few minutes earlier, Deborah<br>
had asked, are you happy? And I said, um, yes,<br>
actually, and Deborah: well, I'm not—<br>
all I do is work and work. And the phone<br>
rang every thirty seconds and between<br>

if she was happy and Catherine said, life<br>
isn't about happiness it's about helping<br>
other people. I shrugged, not knowing how<br>
to respond to such a fine idea.<br>
So, what makes you happy?<br>
Deborah asked, in an accusatory way,<br>
and I said, I guess, the baby, really,<br>
because he makes me stop<br>
working? And Deborah looked sad<br>
and just then her husband called<br>
and Deborah said, Mark, I've got<br>
rachel Zucker here, she's happy,<br>
I'll have to call you back. And then<br>
we left her office and went downstairs<br>
to the salon where a few weeks before<br>
we'd read poems for the Not for Mothers Only<br>
anthology and I especially liked Julie Carr's<br>
poem about crying while driving while listening to<br>
the radio report news of the war while her kids<br>
fought in the back seat while she remembered<br>
her mother crying while driving, listening to<br>
news about the war. There were a lot of poems<br>
that night about crying, about the war, about<br>
fighting, about rage, anger, and work. Afterward<br>
Katy Lederer came up to me and said,<br>
""I don't believe in happiness""—you're such a bitch<br>
for using that line, now no one else can.<br>

there was Catherine in a splash of sunlight<br>

on his way to a room or rooms I've never seen.<br>
And that's when Deborah told Matt that I was<br>
happy and that Catherine thought life wasn't about<br>
happiness and Deborah laughed a little and flipped<br>
her hair (she is quite glamorous) and said, but Matt,<br>
are you happy? Well, Matt said he had a bit of a cold<br>
but otherwise was and that's when he said,<br>
next time you feel yourself going dark in a poem,<br>
just don't, and see what happens. And then,<br>
because it was Julian's sixth birthday, Deborah went<br>
to bring him cupcakes at school and Catherine and I<br>
went to talk to graduate students who teach poetry<br>
to children in hospitals and shelters and other<br>
unhappy places and Matt went up the stairs to the room<br>

I'm here, in bed, turning toward something I haven't felt<br>
for a long while. A few minutes ago I held our baby up<br>

the way toddlers do, wanting to move on to something<br>
else, something next, and his infancy is almost over.<br>

Why do I suffer? What lover<br>
ever had so much pleasure?<br>
de un agravio de amor me lamentaba;<br>
y por ver si la muerte se llegaba,<br>
procuraba que fuese más crecida.<br>
pena por pena su dolor sumaba,<br>
y en cada circunstancia ponderaba<br>
que<br>
mil muertes a una vida.<br>
rendido el corazón daba penoso<br>
señas de dar el último suspiro,<br>
volví en mi acuerdo y dije:—¿Qué me admiro?<br>
¿Quién en amor ha sido más dichoso?",POSITIVE,0.5016223192214966<br>
250,https://poets.org/poem/songs-people,Songs for the People,Frances Ellen Watkins Harper,"Let me make the songs for the people,<br>
Songs for the old and young;<br>
Songs to stir like a battle-cry<br>
Wherever they are sung.<br>
Not for the clashing of sabres,<br>
For carnage nor for strife;<br>
But songs to thrill the hearts of men<br>
With more abundant life.<br>
Let me make the songs for the weary,<br>
Amid life's fever and fret,<br>
Till hearts shall relax their tension,<br>
And careworn brows forget.<br>
Let me sing for little children,<br>
Before their footsteps stray,<br>
Sweet anthems of love and duty,<br>
To float o'er life's highway.<br>
I would sing for the poor and aged,<br>
When shadows dim their sight;<br>
Of the bright and restful mansions,<br>
Where there shall be no night.<br>
Our world, so worn and weary,<br>
Needs music, pure and strong,<br>
To hush the jangle and discords<br>
Of sorrow, pain, and wrong.<br>
Music to soothe all its sorrow,<br>
Till war and crime shall cease;<br>
And the hearts of men grown tender<br>
Girdle the world with peace.",POSITIVE,0.9982495903968811<br>
251,https://poets.org/poem/snowfall-so-silent,The Snowfall Is So Silent,Miguel de Unamuno,"The snowfall is so silent,<br>
so slow,<br>
bit by bit, with delicacy<br>
it settles down on the earth<br>
and covers over the fields.<br>
The silent snow comes down<br>
white and weightless;<br>
snowfall makes no noise,<br>
falls as forgetting falls,<br>
flake after flake.<br>
It covers the fields gently<br>
while frost attacks them<br>
with its sudden flashes of white;<br>
covers everything with its pure<br>
and silent covering;<br>
not one thing on the ground<br>
anywhere escapes it.<br>
And wherever it falls it stays,<br>
content and gay,<br>
for snow does not slip off<br>
as rain does,<br>
but it stays and sinks in.<br>
The flakes are skyflowers,<br>
pale lilies from the clouds,<br>
that wither on earth.<br>
They come down blossoming<br>
but then so quickly<br>
they are gone;<br>
they bloom only on the peak,<br>
above the mountains,<br>
and make the earth feel heavier<br>
when they die inside.<br>
Snow, delicate snow,<br>
that falls with such lightness<br>
on the head,<br>
on the feelings,<br>
come and cover over the sadness<br>
that lies always in my reason.<br>
La nevada es silenciosa<br>
La nevada es silenciosa,<br>
cosa lenta;<br>
poco a poco y con blandura<br>
reposa sobre la tierra<br>
y cobija a la llanura.<br>
Posa la nieve callada<br>
blanca y leve;<br>
la nevada no hace ruido;<br>
cae como cae el olvido,<br>
copo a copo.<br>
Abriga blanda a los campos<br>
cuando el hielo los hostiga;<br>
con sus lampos de blancura;<br>
cubre a todo con su capa<br>
pura, silenciosa;<br>
no se le escapa en el suelo<br>
cosa alguna.<br>
Donde cae allí se queda<br>
leda y leve,<br>
pues la nieve no resbala<br>
como resbala la lluvia,<br>
sino queda y cala.<br>
Flores del cielo los copos,<br>
blancos lirios de las nubes,<br>
que en el suelo se ajan,<br>
bajan floridos,<br>
pero quedan pronto<br>
derretidos;<br>
florecen sólo en la cumbre,<br>
sobre las montañas,<br>
pesadumbre de la tierra,<br>
y en sus entrañas perecen.<br>
Nieve, blanda nieve,<br>
la que cae tan leve<br>
sobre la cabeza,<br>
sobre el corazón,<br>
ven y abriga mi tristeza<br>
la que descansa en razón.",NEGATIVE,0.7813406586647034<br>
